# MySQL Provider

This provider is designed to help you manage resources in a MySQL server within your infrastructure, all with the robustness and convenience of Mashin.

## Introduction to MySQL

MySQL is a renowned open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It's known for its reliability, flexibility, and compliance with the SQL (Structured Query Language) standard. MySQL uses a client-server model, meaning it consists of a database server (MySQL Server) and several different client programs. It's a central component of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python) open-source web application software stack.

MySQL is employed for a wide range of applications, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. However, its most common use case is for web databases. It can store anything from a single record of information to an entire inventory of available products for an online store.

## Mashin MySQL Provider

The Mashin MySQL Provider allows you to manage MySQL resources using the same declarative approach as Mashin. By treating infrastructure as code, you can version control not only your application code but also your databases, leading to an increase in the reproducibility and traceability of changes.

This provider exposes resources used to interact with a MySQL server, such as creating and managing databases, users, permissions, and so forth. It allows for a high degree of automation in managing these resources, making it easier to build, change, and version your MySQL infrastructure.

## Usage

To use the Mashin MySQL Provider, you simply import it into your Mashin scripts.

```ts
import * as mysql from "https://mashin.run/mysql@0.0.0/mod.ts";
```

Remember, as with all Mashin providers, the ultimate goal is to facilitate your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. 

Enjoy the simplicity and power of Mashin and the MySQL provider in making your database infrastructure management tasks more efficient and reliable.
